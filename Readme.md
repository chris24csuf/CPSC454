## Project
#### DC2S
Distributed Cloud Computing with StarCluster (DC2S) utilizes Amazon's EC2 with StarCluster to simulate computational offloading for an android application.

Conceptually, an android application requiring more computional power or resources can delegate such task to a cloud server.
The cloud server equiped with multiple computers will perform the compute-intensive task for the android application.
Cloud or edge computing can be used as way to deliver computing power to mobile phones and IoT devices.

Project environment:
- Android Studio
- AWS EC2
- Linux OS
- StarCluster
- Windows 10
